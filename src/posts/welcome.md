Hello and welcome to the fancy new Aerospace Jam website! The goal of moving again from Carroll's old site is to improve accessibility to all resources related to the competition and make everything easier to navigate for students and teachers alike. If this website doesn't accomplish that goal in your eyes, please don't hesitate to submit feedback.
